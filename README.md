# üö¶ Arduino-Based 4-Way Traffic Signal Simulation

Welcome to the **4-Way Traffic Signal Simulation** project! This educational project is designed to demonstrate how a traffic light control system works using fundamental concepts of Computer Organization and Architecture. By utilizing an Arduino Mega 2560, LEDs, resistors, and the Arduino IDE, we simulate a traffic light system for a 4-way intersection, offering practical insights into how microcontrollers manage traffic flow.

## üß† **Why This Project Matters**

Understanding how microcontrollers control traffic signals helps illustrate the fundamentals of computer architecture, input/output management, and timing control in embedded systems. This project provides a hands-on experience with basic concepts of electronics and control systems, offering a simplified but effective way to grasp how more complex, real-world systems function.

## üéØ **Project Objectives**

- **Simulate a 4-way traffic light** using Arduino Mega 2560 to manage lane transitions and signal timings.
- **Demonstrate microcontroller-based control** using LEDs to replicate red, yellow, and green traffic lights.
- **Understand I/O control** by interfacing LEDs with Arduino pins.
- **Learn the principles of traffic management** through this small-scale simulation.

## üîß **Components Used**

- **Arduino Mega 2560**: The microcontroller serving as the "brain" of the traffic signal system.
- **Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs** (4 of each): Represent the traffic lights for the four lanes.
- **220-ohm Resistors** (12 pieces): Protect the LEDs from excessive current.
- **Jumper Cables**: Connect components on the breadboard.
- **Breadboards**: Serve as the base for assembling the circuit connections.

## üìú **How It Works**

The Arduino-based system manages the traffic lights for a 4-way intersection using a predefined sequence:
1. **Lane 1** receives a green light while other lanes display red.
2. After a set duration (e.g., 7 seconds), **Lane 1** transitions from green to yellow, signaling a change.
3. **Lane 2** then receives the green light while **Lane 1** shifts to red.
4. The process repeats for **Lanes 3** and **4** in a similar manner, creating a full traffic cycle.
5. The system continuously loops, simulating an ongoing traffic flow.

## üí° **Control Signals**

- **Red Light**: Indicates "STOP" for vehicles.
- **Yellow Light**: Acts as a caution, signaling "WAIT" or "GET READY."
- **Green Light**: Grants permission to "GO."

## üîç **Block Diagram Overview**

- A total of 12 LEDs are used, with 3 LEDs per lane (red, yellow, and green).
- Each LED is connected to the Arduino through a 220-ohm resistor to prevent excess current flow, ensuring safe operation.
